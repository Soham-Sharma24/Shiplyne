#  Shiplyne – AI-Powered Truck Rental & Logistics Platform  

##  Overview  
Shiplyne is an intelligent logistics platform that helps **factories rent trucks** efficiently through **real-time bidding, AI-driven pricing, and smart route optimization**. This repository contains the **codebase, models, and database structure** used to power the platform. Our app aims to solve one simple problem in the world of transportation. The problem being if a company employs 10 of the 20 trucks owned by a local transporter the rest of his trucks are sometimes went unused, this leads to wastage of the remaining trucks for some considerable time and yields a low return of investment for the transporter. The same issues are sometimes faced by small factory owners. Not having the means or the capability for investment for a whole transportation team under them they sometimes face problems bargaining with the local transportation companies. With our app/website we aim to make a seamless platform for factory owners and truck drivers. A truck driver can register on our app and factories can search for available truck drivers for specified dates.
